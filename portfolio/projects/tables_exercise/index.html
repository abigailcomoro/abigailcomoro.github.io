        <h2>About my favs</h2>
        <p>Learning and exploring different cultures is something I'm really interested in and have found that music is one of my favorite ways to start exploring! Listening to music in different languages helped with learning different languages. As a Filipino who has mostly lived in America, English is practically my first language, but I still want to learn my native tongue! Listening to Filipino Pop has helped significantly with that. It has also helped me get into the pop culture in the Philippines. Whether I'm learning about what's going on with my favorite artists or what's going on in the Philippines in general (politically or anything else), listening to Filipino Pop has helped me become more intrigued by my culture. Along with Filipino Pop, Kpop, VPop, Jpop, Pop, and R&B have also helped me with learning about different cultures and their languages. Going more into culture, I've tried many more foods now than if I probably, didn't explore more. Although there are other ways to learn about different cultures, to me, music is a great start before branching out more.</p>

        <h2>What makes me like these songs?</h2>
        <p>"There are so many songs out there. Why these in particular?" is what you may be asking. My answer would be the ambiance of them. If you were to play these songs, not many of them are as hard-hitting as rap or as soft as ballads. Although I have my playlists for when I'm in the mood to look out the window on the gloomy, rainy day or go to the gym to get pumped for a workout, my favorites listed here are just songs that make me happy and calm. They're something I can lip-sync my heart out in the car and sing in the shower. Going back to the cultural part of it, even though some songs here are in different languages, the tone of the song and vocals from the singer still resonate that type of feeling even though I don't fully understand. </p>
