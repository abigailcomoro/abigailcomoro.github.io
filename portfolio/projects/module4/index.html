            <h2>Who and Where I am Today</h2>
            <p>My name is Abigail Comoro and I am 24 years old. I was born in the Philippines and moved to Texas in a small town called Kingsville with my family at the age of four (4). My parents put me in a ballet class which started my love for dance (and dance in general)! I was in a dance team until middle school because we moved to Houston when I was eleven (11). Once I was in high school, I was a part of a dance team which I loved. Once I graduated, I ended up earning my associates degree in business. Although it was pretty nice earning the degree, I felt that my love for the arts was too prominent and I needed a more artistic major. Finally deciding where I am today, getting a degree in Graphic Design.</p>
            <p>As a life goal for myself, I want to try almost every genre of dance. I'm not sure if this is really a part of dance but I've been really liking aerial dance. I also love baking and although it may be basic, I love baking bread!</p>

                <h2>My North Star</h2>
                <p>A goal I would like to accomplish in the future as a graphic designer would have to be designing an album for a big artist. Even more further into the future, I would love to move up to be a creative director. Even end up being the main creative to design the overall look and feel of an album. Although designing albums is all I've been talking about, there are many other things I would love to design! Those include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Posters</li>
                    <li>Packaging for brands</li>
                    <li>Logos</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Just to name a few!</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Accomplishments so far</h2>
                    <p>The biggest accomplishment I've achieved is earning my Associates in Business degree. Although I haven't done much in the field of graphic design, I would like to say that in my classes, the projects I feel I've shown my best work in was when I created a menu for a restaurant and a brochure for a travel business.</p>

                        <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
                        <p>As mentioned, my goal is to design and create many projects! I feel like with my background in business, it can also help with the fact that I want to further my career and become a creative director. As a goal for this year, I would like to start an graphic design internship to gain experience in the field by Fall 2024. Hopefully, this will help jumpstart my career as a graphic designer!</p>
